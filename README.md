### About Me

- :technologist: I'm a Senior Software Engineer, Frontend @loyalhealth. My forte lies in developing user interfaces with React and TypeScript.

- :headphones: Currently coding on:
  - UIs @loyalhealth
  - Whatever crazy ideas I can come up with using ChatGPT
  - [refactor-display-if](https://github.com/rickMcGavin/refactor-display-if)

- :closed_book: Currently reading: [Software Engineering the Soft Parts by Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/blog/software-engineering-soft-parts/)
- :dog: When I'm not coding, I can be found reading books, gaming, participating in cybersecurity challenges, hanging out with my family and dogs.
